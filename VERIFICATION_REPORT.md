# Bug Fix Verification Report

## Issue: Turn-Switching Bug During Placement Phase

### Original Report
"When there's one piece left to place by red player, the piece count stops incrementing and red player can keep playing pieces without switching turns."

### Status: ✅ RESOLVED

---

## What Was Actually Happening

The bug report described a symptom that occurred when players formed winning configurations during placement. The actual behavior was:

1. **Game Logic**: Working correctly - detected square wins and ended game
2. **Controller**: Working correctly - set `game_over = True` and returned victory message
3. **GUI**: **Bug Found** - did not check for game-over condition after placement, so:
   - Victory message not displayed
   - Game not visibly ended
   - Player thought they could keep playing

---

## Root Cause

In `src/gui.py`, the `handle_placement_click()` method:
- ❌ Did NOT check if `controller.is_game_over()`
- ❌ Did NOT set `self.game_over = True` to prevent further clicks
- ❌ Did NOT display the victory message

This allowed the GUI to remain interactive even though the game controller had ended the game.

---

## Solution

Updated `handle_placement_click()` method in `src/gui.py` to:

```python
def handle_placement_click(self, row, col):
    """Handle click during placement phase"""
    success, message = self.controller.place_piece(row, col)
    
    if success:
        self.play_sound('move')
        
        # ✅ NEW: Check for winner first
        if self.controller.is_game_over():
            self.game_over = True
            self.play_sound('trumpet')
            self.show_message(message, 5000)
        # Check if entering movement phase
        elif self.controller.board.get_phase() == "movement":
            self.show_message("All pieces placed! Movement phase begins.")
        else:
            self.show_message(f"✓ {message}")
    else:
        self.show_message(f"✗ {message}", 2000)
```

## Verification Tests

### Test 1: Turn Switching (Basic)
```
Alice → Bob → Alice → Bob → Alice → Bob → Alice → Bob ✓
```
**Result**: ✅ Players alternate correctly throughout placement

### Test 2: Victory Detection During Placement
```
Scenario: Red forms 2×2 square at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)
Move 7: Red places at (1,1) → 🎉 Red wins at placement phase!
Game Over: True
Winner: Red
```
**Result**: ✅ Victory properly detected and game ends

### Test 3: Full Game Cycle
```
8 placements → All pieces placed → Phase: movement ✓
Turn switching continues in movement phase
```
**Result**: ✅ Normal game flow when no victory occurs

### Test 4: Prevention of Further Moves After Victory
```
After game_over = True:
  handle_click() returns immediately
  No further piece placements possible
```
**Result**: ✅ GUI properly prevents interaction

## Impact Summary

| Aspect | Before Fix | After Fix |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Turn Switching | ✓ Working | ✓ Working |
| Victory During Placement | ✗ Not displayed | ✓ Displayed |
| Game State After Victory | ✗ Remained interactive | ✓ Properly ended |
| Player Feedback | ❌ Confusing | ✅ Clear |
| GUI Responsiveness | ❌ Bug-inducing | ✅ Correct |

---

## Conclusion

The reported bug was a **GUI interaction bug**, not a turn-switching bug. The game logic was working correctly all along. The fix ensures the GUI properly responds to game-ending conditions and provides appropriate user feedback.

**Bug Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

The game now:
- ✅ Alternates turns correctly
- ✅ Detects victories during placement
- ✅ Ends the game immediately upon victory
- ✅ Prevents further moves after game end
- ✅ Displays appropriate victory messages

## Recent updates (Nov 13, 2025)

- Verification notes: ensure GUI tests check background scaling (`BOARD_SCALE`) visual behavior and that click mapping uses the centered `grid_origin_x`/`grid_origin_y`.
- Use `calibrate_board.py` and `detect_offset.py` during verification to ensure piece alignment across different board images and scales.
